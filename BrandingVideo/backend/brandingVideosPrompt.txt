Objective
We aim to create engaging company branding videos for paid employers on our platform. Your task is to develop a voice-over script using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) that will be converted into speech by a text-to-speech model.

Guidelines:
Write the script using SSML format.
Provide distinct SSML scripts for each screen.
Avoid repeating screen content verbatim; instead, craft a narrative that flows naturally as if delivered by a content creator.
Ensure each script adheres to the specified time limits.
Structure the scripts to allow seamless transitions between screens, maintaining a cohesive audio experience throughout.
Use relevant data and replace it in script from api response given below.
